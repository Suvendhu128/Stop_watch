# Stopwatch

This is a simple stopwatch written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to start, stop, and reset the timer.

## Usage

To use the stopwatch, simply click on the "Start" button. The timer will start counting up. To stop the timer, click on the "Stop" button. To reset the timer, click on the "Reset" button.

## Code

The code for the stopwatch is available in the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js` files.
# HTML
The code you have provided is the body of an HTML code that contains the following elements:

* A div tag with the id `timer` that will display the stopwatch time.
* A div tag with the id `buttons` that contains three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset.
* A script tag that references the `script.js` file, which contains the JavaScript code for the stopwatch.

The following is a breakdown of the code:

```
<body>

    <div id="timer">00:00:00</div>
    <div id="buttons">
        <button id="start">Start</button>
        <button id="stop">Stop</button>
        <button id="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

The `div` tag with the id `timer` is used to create a container for the stopwatch time. The text inside the `div` tag will be the current time of the stopwatch.

The `div` tag with the id `buttons` is used to create a container for the three buttons. The buttons will be used to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.

The `script` tag is used to reference the `script.js` file. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the stopwatch. This code will be used to update the stopwatch time, start and stop the stopwatch, and reset the stopwatch.
# JAVASCRIPT
The code defines the following variables:

* `timerEl`: A reference to the DOM element with the id `timer`. This element will be used to display the stopwatch time.
* `startButtonEl`: A reference to the DOM element with the id `start`. This element represents the start button.
* `stopButtonEl`: A reference to the DOM element with the id `stop`. This element represents the stop button.
* `resetButtonEl`: A reference to the DOM element with the id `reset`. This element represents the reset button.
* `startTime`: The start time of the stopwatch.
* `elapsedTime`: The elapsed time of the stopwatch.
* `timerInterval`: The interval ID for the timer.

The code also defines the following functions:

* `startTimer()`: This function is called when the start button is clicked. It starts the stopwatch by getting the current time and setting the `startTime` variable to that value. It then creates an interval that calls the `formatTime()` function every 10 milliseconds. The `formatTime()` function formats the elapsed time and sets the text of the `timerEl` element to the formatted time.
* `stopTimer()`: This function is called when the stop button is clicked. It stops the stopwatch by clearing the `timerInterval` variable.
* `resetTimer()`: This function is called when the reset button is clicked. It resets the stopwatch by setting the `startTime`, `elapsedTime`, and `timerInterval` variables to 0. It also sets the text of the `timerEl` element to "00:00:00".

The code then binds the `click` event handlers for the start, stop, and reset buttons to the `startTimer()`, `stopTimer()`, and `resetTimer()` functions, respectively.
